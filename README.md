# solana-llm-contracts-generation

## Project Overview
This project performs a comparative analysis of four LLMs' ability to generate Anchor programs: **Claude**, **Copilot**, **DeepSeek**, and **ChatGPT**. The benchmark uses Anchor programs from https://github.com/blockchain-unica/rosetta-smart-contracts as reference implementations.

## Project Structure
- **Code_Generation/**: Contains all generated code from each LLM
- **Prompt_Strategies/**: Includes all prompts used for generation
- **Use_Cases/**: Contains original benchmark code with corresponding tests
