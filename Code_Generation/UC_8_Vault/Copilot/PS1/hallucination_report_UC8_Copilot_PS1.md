## Identified Hallucinations

### Context Deviation: Inconsistency
**Description:** 

The code unnecessarily assigns mutable qualifiers to variables that are never modified.

**Code Example:**
```rust
    let mut from_account = vault_ai; // owned clone
    let mut to_account = receiver_ai; // owned clone
```
