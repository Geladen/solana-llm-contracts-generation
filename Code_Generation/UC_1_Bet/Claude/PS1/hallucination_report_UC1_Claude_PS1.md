## Identified Hallucinations

### [Context Repetition]
**Description:** 
There is an identical and redundant double check in two different portions of the code. The same oracle authorization validation is performed both in the account constraints and within the instruction logic, creating unnecessary duplication.

**Code Example:**
```rust
constraint = bet_info.oracle == oracle.key() @ BettingError::UnauthorizedOracle

require!(ctx.accounts.oracle.key() == oracle_key, BettingError::UnauthorizedOracle);
